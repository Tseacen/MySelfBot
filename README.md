# MySelfBot
A really very simple Discord bot, made in JavaScript with the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) (v12) library with the aim of copying yourself (or another member).

## Setup
1. Download the [latest Version](https://github.com/Tseacen/MySelfBot/releases) of the bot
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 is recommended, or higher)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Rename the file `config.example.js` to `config.js`
5. Create a App (bot) with [Discord Developer](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## Configuration
The configuration file is `config.js`.
You're not supposed to modify anything else unless you know what you're doing.

`"token":"Your token here"`
Modify **Your token here"** by your bot token, that you will get with [Discord Developer](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

`"user":"User ID"`
Modify **User ID** by your user id .This is the ID that the bot will refer to.

# Run
`node index.js`
